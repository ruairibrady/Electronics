## Excercise 5: RC Network Decay
This exercise examines the exponential decay of an [RC network](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/1.%20RC%20network%20decay%20(5)/5_circuit.JPG) as a 2.5 V square wave is driven through it using three different methods. Firstly, an equation detailing the circuit’s theoretical decay is derived according to Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. It is found that when the time equals the product of the resistor and capacitor used, a special point known as the circuit time constant is reached. Here, the voltage output of the system will have decayed by [63% its initial input](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/1.%20RC%20network%20decay%20(5)/Theory/40.1_5_resistances.ipynb). For this RC network, a resistor and capacitor of strength 1.0 kΩ and 1 μF are used to provide a theoretical time constant value of 1 ms. A simulation of the circuit is then run using the SPICE based electronics design software TINA and a time constant value of [0.997 ± 0.001 ms](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/1.%20RC%20network%20decay%20(5)/Simulation/5_simulation.jpg) is gotten. Along with this, the circuit was constructed on a breadboard to be physically analysed. A digital oscilloscope recorded an experimental time constant value of [1.00 ± 0.01 ms](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/1.%20RC%20network%20decay%20(5)/Experimental/5_oscilloscope.png) for the system.
## Excercise 7: RC Amplitude and Phase
This exercise examines the Bode plots of the [RC network](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/2.%20RC%20amplitude%20and%20phase%20(7)/7_circuit.JPG) discussed in exercise 5 previous. The gain and phase change is studied as a 2.5 V sinusoidal alternating wave is driven through the circuit at a range of different frequencies. Once again, the various outcomes are analysed using three different methods. Firstly, a set of equations detailing the circuit’s theoretical gain and phase change are derived. When the time equals the product of the resistor and capacitor used, the time constant is once again reached where the capacitor is 63% charged. The oscillating frequency \omega corresponds to the inverse of this time constant value. It is found that at this point, \omega, the amplitude of the transmitted signal has a gain of approximately -3.01 dB and a phase angle change of 45°. A simulation of the circuit is then run using the SPICE based electronics design software TINA and it is found that a [gain of -3.01 dB]((https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/2.%20RC%20amplitude%20and%20phase%20(7)/amplitude/Simulation/7_simulation_amplitude.jpg)) occurs at \omega = 9.980x10-4. It also found that a [phase change of 45°](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/2.%20RC%20amplitude%20and%20phase%20(7)/phase/Simulation/7_simulation_phase.jpg) occurred at \omega = 1.000x10-4. Finally, the output voltage was recorded and compared to the input voltage for the circuit constructed in exercise 5 as the frequency varied. The data collected allowed for a set of experimental Bode plots to be created. It was found that a [gain of -3.01 dB](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/2.%20RC%20amplitude%20and%20phase%20(7)/amplitude/Experimental/40.2_7_amplitude.ipynb) was gotten with a [phase change of 45.0°](https://github.com/ruairibrady/Electronics/blob/master/2.%20RC%20amplitude%20and%20phase%20(7)/phase/Experimental/40.3_7_phase.ipynb).
